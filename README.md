# Hi, I'm ialwayslikedgrime / grimey_s

Welcome to my space on GitHub.


I'm a passionate AI student (university of Pavia) from Northern Italy, currently enrolled at the Mathematik Fakultät at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin for the full 2025/2026 academic year. 

My journey into AI started with two pivotal moments: falling in love with coding during a Python course in 2019 (part of my BSc in Business Management), and discovering my passion for AI in early 2020 while reading "The Deep Learning Revolution by Terrence Sejnowski." After completing my MSc in Accounting and Finance from a top-ranked program (1st in Europe, 19th worldwide by QS), I chose to pursue this passion full-time. I chose to pursue a formal education because I was driven by the deep desire of deeply understanding this technology.
