# 👋 Hi, I’m ialwayslikedgrrime (aka grimey_s)

Welcome to my space on GitHub.  
I’m an Artificial Intelligence student and builder, currently exploring:

- 🧩 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — from classic sentiment analysis to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)  
- 🏡 **Machine Learning for Real Estate & Market Data** — e.g., my Airbnb Milan project on occupancy and revenue drivers  
- 🎙️ **AI Applications for Students** — working on a Whisper-based transcription app
