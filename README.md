# 👋 Hi, I'm Stella

Welcome to my space on GitHub.

I'm a passionate AI student from Northern Italy, currently enrolled at the Mathematik Fakultät at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin for the full 2025/2026 academic year. I am originally from the Artificial Intelligence course at University of Pavia.

My journey into AI started with two pivotal moments: falling in love with coding during a Python course in 2019 (part of my BSc in Business Management), and discovering my passion for AI in early 2020 while reading "The Deep Learning Revolution" by Terrence Sejnowski. After completing my MSc in Accounting and Finance from a top-ranked program (1st in Europe, 19th worldwide by QS), I chose to pursue this passion full-time through formal education.

## Current Projects

- **[Multi-Input Multi-Output Neural Network](https://github.com/ialwayslikedgrime/deep_learning_exam_implementation)** – Designed and implemented a **multi-modal sentiment analysis system** for hotel reviews.  
  - Combined **NLP (LSTM branch)** with **structured metadata (categorical branch)** using the Keras Functional API.  
  - Tackled **multi-task learning**: simultaneous **classification (positive/negative)** and **regression (review score prediction)**.  
  - Built a **full preprocessing pipeline** (text cleaning, tokenization, categorical encoding, temporal/geographic features).  
  - Explored **hyperparameter optimization** (random search over learning rates, dropout, architecture size) and achieved robust performance across tasks.  
  - Repo includes clear documentation of design choices, architecture visualization, and notebook implementation.

- **[Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/ialwayslikedgrime/airbnb-milan-price-prediction)** – Machine learning pipeline using real-world data with comprehensive EDA, feature engineering, and model optimization


- **[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/ialwayslikedgrime/Particle_Swarm_Optimization)**
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) – From-scratch implementation of a swarm intelligence algorithm, part of the broader family of evolutionary and genetic-inspired optimization techniques. Vectorized with NumPy and engineered with OOP principles. 

- **NLP Research & Learning** – Documentation of my deep-dive studies including Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and classical NLP techniques



In my free time, I enjoy web development . I built a transcription app powered by whisper that accepts youtube or audio files as input and gives back the text. I am actively learning about deployment.
